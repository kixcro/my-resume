    <p>Hi all! I'm a creative individual who thrives on bringing new ideas to life. Whether 
        it's design, music, or any outlet for expressing my creativity, I'm all in.
        <br />
        As a former informatics teacher, I had a blast creating interactive and fun 
        lessons that made learning a joy. But when I switched to IT support, I felt my 
        creative side wasn't shining as much as I'd like. So, I decided to follow my 
        dream of becoming a UI/UX designer and frontend developer.
